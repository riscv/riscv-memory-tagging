[[tagging]]
== Memory tagging extension (Zimte)

The Zimte extension divides address space of the program in equal memory chunks
of 16 bytes (hereafter `mc`). Each `mc` in address space can be associated with
a tag (hereafter `mc_tag`) by software and `mc_tag` for `mc` is stored in
memory defined by extension Svatag (see <<virtualtag>>).

Software (runtime memory allocator or compiler) that constructs pointers to
access memory (and thus memory chunks) is expected to place a tag (hereafter
`pointer_tag`) in high unused bits of the pointer as defined by the pointer
masking extensions cite:[PMASKING]. Thus `Zimte` depends on the pointer masking
extension and is applicable to only for XLEN=64. Pointer masking has to be
enabled as a requirement for memory tagging to be enabled in the execution
environment.

To maintain binary compatibility with implementations where memory tagging
extension may not be implemented or may not be enabled for a workload,
instruction encodings for memory tagging are taken from zimop cite:[ZIMOP]
encoding and thus make memory tagging extension dependent on zimop.

=== Tag widths

Width of the `pointer_tag` (hereafter `pointer_tag_width`) can be 4 bit or 7
bit wide depending on implementation. Discovery of `pointer_tag_width` is
described in <<MEMTAG_CSR_CTRL>> section. Width of the `mc_tag` (hereafter
`mc_tag_width`) is dependent on the `pointer_tag_width`. Following table
describes valid configurations of `pointer_tag_width` and `mc_tag_width`.

=== Tag placement in pointer

Zimte defines following instructions to annotate a pointer with `pointer_tag`
and perform arithmetics on `pointer_tag` in a tagged pointer. Placement and
arithmetics on `pointer_tag` are performed in-place in masked bits (as defined
by pointer masking extension) starting at b63. Instructions introduced to
place and perform arithmetics on `pointer_tag` are encoded using `MOP.RR.1`
from zimop extension.

[NOTE]
====
Existing RISC-V instructions can also be used to place (and do arithmetics)
`pointer_tag` in masked bits of a pointer. But doing so increases code size,
more so if tagging for stack memory is enabled. And new instructions help
contain the code size growth.
====

Following are the instructions to place `pointer_tag` in the source register

==== Generate a tag - gentag rs1

If memory tagging is enabled in the current execution environment (see
<<MEM_TAG_EN>>), hart randomly generates a `pointer_tag` value, clears
`rs1[b63:pointer_tag_width]` bits in `rs1` and performs an OR operation with
`rs1[b63:pointer_tag_width]` and places the result back in `rs1`.

], config:{lanes: 1, hspace:1024}}
....

==== Arithmetics on tag - addtag rs1

`addtag rs1` is pseudo for `gentag rs1` with `tag_imm4 != 0`. If memory tagging
is enabled in the current execution environment (see <<MEM_TAG_EN>>), hart
performs an add of `tag_imm4` to `pointer_tag` bits
(`rs1[b63:pointer_tag_width]`) in `rs1` by adding  and place the result back in
`rs1[b63:pointer_tag_width]`.

  {bits:  7, name: '1000011', attr:['addtag']},
], config:{lanes: 1, hspace:1024}}
....

[NOTE]
=====
addtag instruction can be used by the compiler for generating distinct pointer
tags derived from a base tag (base tag obtained via gentag). Compiler can use
this mechanism to assign different tags (with same base tag) for consecutive
objects on stack and mitigate adjacent overflow bugs. This also helps with
language runtime during events like exception unwind to calculate tags for
objects on stack in a deterministic manner.
=====

[[TAG_STORE]]
=== set tag(s) for memory chunk(s)

Zimte defines an instruction to store tag (i.e. `pointer_tag`) value(s) for
consecutive 1 to 16 memory chunk(s). Base address of the first memory chunk is
calculated by doing `rs1 & (~0xF)`. Count of memory chunk is encoded as 4 bit
immediate (#chunk_count) in the instruction. This instruction is encoded using
`MOP.RR.0` from zimop extension. Immediate encodings in #chunk_count are zero
based and thus #chunk_count = 0 means first chunk and #chunk_count = 15 means
16th chunk.

[NOTE]
====
Load tag operation is omitted from extension definition because its not
needed. Situations where load tag is required deemed to be not performance
critical paths. Furthermore, if software desires to read tag in these non-
performance critical paths, it can do so by creating an alternate read-only
mapping of tag storage with the help of supervisor software.

Since extension is still in development phase, if load tag operation is
required by software, it can be added.
====

==== Store tag(s) for memory chunk(s): settag rs1, #chunk_count

If memory tagging is enabled in the current execution environment (see
<<MEM_TAG_EN>>), `settag` instruction creates a `mc_tag` =
`rs1[b63:pointer_tag_width]` and stores `mc_tag(s)` for consecutive memory
chunks encoded by `chunk_count` starting with the first memory chunk calculated
from virtual address specified in `rs1`.

  {bits:  7, name: '1000001', attr:['settag']},
], config:{lanes: 1, hspace:1024}}
....

==== Set a memory chunk in accessible: setinvtag rs1, #chunk_count

A memory chunk is inaccessible, if `mc_tag` for memory chunk is set to invalid
tag value. If memory tagging is enabled in the current execution environment
(see <<MEM_TAG_EN>>), `setinvtag` instruction creates `mc_tag` = `invalid_tag`
and stores `mc_tag(s)` for consecutive memory chunks encoded by `chunk_count`
starting with the first memory chunk calculated from virtual address specified
in `rs1`. A load/store to a memory chunk must raise a software check exception
(see <<TAG_CHECKS>>) if `mc_tag` for that memory chunk is set to
`invalid_tag` value. Encoding of `invalid_tag` differ based on `mc_tag_width`.
Following table describes `invalid_tag` encodings for different configurations.

[NOTE]
=====
An invalid tag awareness in hart allows software to implement quarantine of
memory more reliably and efficiently without reserving a tag. This also helps
software to create redzones and smaller than page size guard gaps efficiently
between memory objects.
=====

[NOTE]
====
.Note on tag stores
When `pointer_tag_width = 4 bit`, `mc_tag` (stored) width is 4 bit and thus
maximum width of tag store operation can be 64 bit wide (each memory chunk
needs 4 bit tag and maximum possible chunks are 16. 4x16 = 64 bit). When
`pointer_tag_width = 7 bit`, `mc_tag` (stored) width is 8 bit and thus maximum
width of tag store operation can be 128 bit wide (each memory chunk needs 8 bit
and maximum possible chunks are 16. 8x16 = 128 bit).
====

`settag` and `setinvtag` are read, modify and then write operation on the
memory region defined by Svatag extension and there are no atomicity
requirements on the implementation. If atomicity is desired then it is
software's responsibility.

`settag` and `setinvtag` can generate store operations larger than maximum
store width supported by implementation and implementation may choose to split
it into multiple stores with no ordering requirements or dependencies among
splitted stores.

* Memory ordering requirement

  A memory access (load or store) to some virtual address `va` can not bypass
  the older store initiated by `settag/setinvtag rs1=va`.

  This specification defines tag as the entity associated to virtual addresses.
  In case of aliasing (multiple virtual addresses map to same physical address),
  it is software's responsibility to ensure that the tags are set according to
  software's need for respective virtual address prior to memory accesses via
  aliased virtual address.

* Exceptions

  `settag/setinvtag` can raise store page fault or access fault depending on
  how tag storage is oragnized. If implementation doesn't support misaligned
  accesses, `settag/setinvtag` instruction can raise misaligned exception if
  calculated address for locating tag is unaligned.

[[TAG_CHECKS]]
=== tag checks
If memory tagging is enabled in the current execution environment (see
<<MEM_TAG_EN>>) and page is marked as tagged page (see <<TAGGED_PAGE>>) in the
first stage page table, all regular loads and stores to memory chunks (`mc`)
in that page are subject to following checks

* If `mc_tag` corresponding to `mc` is invalid, hart raises a software check
  exception with tval = 4

* If `mc_tag` is valid, hart evaluates expression `mc_tag == pointer_tag` and
  if false then hart raises a software check exception with tval = 4.

If a load / store is subject to tag checks, fetching `mc_tag` from the tag
memory region holding tags may also result in a load page fault or load access
fault and thus the hart report the virtual address of the tag in `xtval`.

[[ASYNC_SW_CHECK]]
=== Asynchronous reporting for tag mismatches

To improve performance, software check exceptions due to tag mismatches on
stores can be reported asynchronously. This means that reported `epc` might not
be the reason for tag mismatch and software must do additional analysis to
infer which store resulted in software check exception. This behavior is can
be optionally turned on through `__x__envcfg` CSR for next less privilege mode
(see <<MEMTAG_CSR_CTRL>>).

Note that tag check violations on loads must always be reported synchronously.

[[TAGGED_PAGE]]
=== Tag checks on page basis

Memory tagging extension extends first stage page table by introducing a new
leaf PTE bit (bit position TBD) termed as `MTAG`. If an implementation
implements memory tagging extension then `PTE.MTAG` is no more a reserved bit,
irrespective of memory tagging is enabled or not for current execution
environment.

If memory tagging is enabled for the current execution environment (see
<<MEM_TAG_EN>>) and PTE.MTAG = 1, then the page is considered a tagged page and
load / stores to such a page are subject to tag checks (see <<TAG_CHECKS>>).

[NOTE]
====
A bit in page table entry allows software to enable memory tagging on per-page
basis and thus can have several discontigous regions on which tagging can be
enabled. Depending on complexity of program and memory allocator(s), software
can choose to enable on per-page basis. Furthermore, this allows software to
enable memory tagging only for heap.
====

[[MEMTAG_CSR_CTRL]]
=== CSR bits for memory tagging

In M-mode, enable for memory tagging and subsequent behavior of Zimte
instructions is implementation specific. Although if an implementation is not
enabling memory tagging for M-mode, it must follow zimop behavior for Zimte
instructions in M-mode.

Enablement for privilege modes less than M-mode is controlled through
`__x__envcfg` CSR. Zimte adds two bits termed as `MTE_MODE` to `__x__envcfg` CSR which
controls enabling of memory tagging and `pointer_tag_width` for the next
privilege mode. A `MT_ASYNC` bit is added to `__x__envcfg` CSR and if set,
software check exceptions due to tag mismatches on store operations can be
reported asynchronously (see <<ASYNC_SW_CHECK>>).

[[MEM_TAG_EN]]
==== Memory tagging enable and pointer_tag_width

The term `xMTE_MODE` is used to determine if memory tagging is enabled in
current execution environment (privilege mode).

Following table describes different encodings of `MTE_MODE` and corresponding
configuration

.`MTE_MODE` encoding and its meaning
[width=100%]
[%header, cols="^4,^12"]
|===
|`MTE_MODE` | Memory tagging state
|  00       | Disabled
|  01       | Reserved
|  10       | Enabled, pointer_tag_width = 4
|  11       | Enabled, pointer_tag_width = 7
|===

  If memory tagging is implemented, implementation must implement
  `pointer_tag_width = 4` at minimum. To discover maximum supported
  `pointer_tag_width`, software can write `0b11` to `MTE_MODE` field in the
  `__x__envcfg` CSR and read it back. If read back value is `0b11` then
  implementation supports both `pointer_tag` widths.

  If xMTE_MODE == 0b00 then xMTE_MODE.MT_ASYNC becomes WPRI
