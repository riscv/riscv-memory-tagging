== Introduction

Significant production software is written in languages which provide
powerful memory management primitives (like C/C++).
Software is written in collaborative fashion and on tight deadlines and bugs do
get introduced.
A subset of these bugs introduce issues commonly termed as "memory safety"
issues. The root causes of memory safety issues are numerous but eventually
such issues surface as invalid memory accesses with regards to the
language specification.

Programs use pointers to access memory. We refer to the parts of the programs
in which accessing an object is valid as its "lifetime". An object's
lifetime depends on the region of memory it is stored on:

* **Heap**: A memory allocator uses operating system facilities to
  create large memory mappings and expose APIs so that software can manage
  (allocate and free) memory at their convenience. As an example `malloc`
  allocates a specified number of bytes and returns a pointer to the
  allocated memory; `free` frees the memory so that allocator can recycle
  that memory. Depending on the operating system, there might be many similar
  APIs (e.g. `calloc`, `memalign`, etc.), but they are always paired with a
  corresponding `free` call.
  The lifetime of an object on the heap is between `malloc` (or similar) and
  `free`.

* **Stack**: The operating system allocates a region to be used as the stack of
  the program. When a function is called, a stack frame is created at the top
  of the stack. This is used to hold local variables, which are accessed
  relative to the stack pointer, which designates the top of the stack.
  Upon return from the function, the frame is popped from the stack by
  adjusting the stack pointer. Within a stack frame, the compiler can reuse
  the same memory for local variables that have non-overlapping lifetimes
  (known as stack coloring, implemented e.g. in LLVM StackColoring
  cite:[LLVM_StackColoring]). The lifetime of an object on the stack is
  governed by the programming language's scoping rules (e.g. C++ scoping rules
  cite:[CppScope]).

* **Globals**: Storage for global variables is allocated by the operating system
  on process startup (or when the dynamic object is loaded). Generally, the
  storage for globals is destroyed on process shutdown (depending on the OS,
  `dlclose` might cause it to be destoyed earlier).
  The lifetime of a global ends when the process is terminated, or the dynamic
  object is unloaded.

In addition, an object has a size that represents the amount of memory
allocated for it, and except for reassignment, a pointer must always point to
memory of the object it was previously assigned to point to.

Two prominent patterns of invalid memory accesses are:

* **Temporal**: A pointer is dereferenced past the lifetime of the object
  it refers to. With respect to heap memory, such issues are commonly
  called "use after free" (UAF). In case of stack, such issues are termed as
  "stack use after return", "stack use after scope".

* **Spatial**: A pointer outside of the bounds of the object it refers to
  be created, leading to invalid memory access when dereferenced. This is
  commonly referred to as a "buffer overflow" (sometimes also "buffer
  underflow"), or "out of bounds".

To catch these issues, we can check memory accesses for validity at runtime.
We do this by employing a lock and key scheme. Memory is assigned a memory tag
(lock). Each pointer is assigned a pointer tag (key) in its unused top bits.
On access, the key needs to match the lock, or the program is terminated.

When the lifetime of an object starts (e.g. `malloc` is called), we assign the
same tag as a memory tag (lock) for the `size` bytes representing the object,
and pointer tag (key). Subsequent in-bounds accesses using that pointer are
valid. When the lifetime of the object ends (e.g. `free` is called), we change the
memory tag (lock). Subsequent accesses through the pointer (which remains
unchanged) will be invalid and terminate the program.

Existing software mechanisms using compiler instrumentation and runtime
support exist:

* HWAddressSanitizer (HWAsan) cite:[HWASAN] which uses pointer-masking to
  implement the idea explained above.
* AddressSanitizer (ASan) cite:[ASAN] which is fully implemented in software,
  but in a different way to the idea above.

However software approach has significant cost from performance perspective and
are mostly limited to unit test, developer test or special test harness (like
fuzzing) environments. Hardware assistance in management and checking of `tags`
on memory accesses helps in more scalable testing of software in variety of
deployment scenarios including production.

Leveraging this software usage model, the `Zimte` extension defines a mechanism
for tagged pointer construction, tag management instructions to store tags and
tag checks on memory accesses (pointer dereferences). `Svatag` and `Smvatag`
extensions defines tag storage mechanism in virtual memory along with protection
mechanisms for tag storage.
